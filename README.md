### Pre-Requisite Knowledge

While Gooba is designed to be beginner-friendly, we need to establish a baseline so that the documentation can stay focused on Gooba’s functionality. We'll ensure to provide links to relevant resources whenever we introduce a new concept.

To get the most out of this documentation, it’s recommended that you have a basic understanding of:

-   **Python programming**: Understanding basic Python syntax, variables, functions, and object-oriented programming is essential for working with Gooba’s components and structures.
-   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Familiarity with creating classes, methods, and objects will help you manipulate elements and build components in Gooba.

If you're new to Python or OOP, feel free to explore introductory Python resources before diving into Gooba.
